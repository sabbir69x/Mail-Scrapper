# üìß Telegram Email Scraper

This Python script uses Telethon to **scrape email addresses** from Telegram messages. It is designed to collect emails specifically ending with "@gmail.com". The scraped emails are then saved to a text file.

## Usage

1. Make sure to replace the placeholders for `API_ID` and `API_HASH` with your own Telegram API credentials.

2. Run the script and use the command `/scrmail [username or url] [amount]` in a Telegram to start scraping emails.

3. The scraped emails will be saved in a text file located at `/storage/emulated/0/STxScrap/Files/`, if you dont have this path, create one!.
